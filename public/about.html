			Created as a HackHarvard 2017 project, Adopt a Best Friend is designed to cut out the middleman in shelters and create a safer and kinder enviornment for domestic animals.  By letting users connect home-foster friend-home we hope to cut down on the millions of animal deaths a year caused by shelters around the world.
